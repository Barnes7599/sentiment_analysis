<h4> **Description:** </h4>

Sentiment analysis is the study of subjective feelings expressed in text and has recently attracted significant attention from both the research community and industry. As social media, opinions and product reviews continue to influence consumer preferences, more and more companies are seeking ways to determine a consumers attitude towards their products and services. 

With all the hype around Elon taking a [9.2% stake](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/elon-musks-9percent-stake-in-twitter-and-board-seat-heres-what-it-means.html) in twitter and his offer to purchase twitter for [$43 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-buying-twitter-doesnt-care-economics-trusted-public-platform-2022-4), I thought instead of scrapping reviews or opinions of a company's products or services, I decided to analyze Elon Musk's tweets!. 

The data was downloaded from NuttySalmon on [GitHub](https://github.com/NuttySalmon). Though the purpose of their repo was to analyze Elon Musk's Tweets vs Tesla Stock using machine learning algorithms in python, I thought the data would be just as good to conduct a sentiment analysis. Check it out [here](https://github.com/NuttySalmon/Elon-Musk-Tweets-VS-Tesla-Stock).
